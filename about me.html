     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <body style="background-color:crimson"> My name is Aditya and I live in Mountain House, California. My hobbies are reading and sleeping. My favorite animal is a chameleon because of its colors, and my favorite subject is (<i>obviously</i>) science. I am a boy and enjoy making these kinds of websites.
