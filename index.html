   <p>This is for the people who want to become astronauts, astronomers, or people who
      are just plain interested in space.
      I am a kid who wants to grow up to become an astronomer. I hope you guys want to too! This site will include a
      lot of information about the whole universe. You could also give me tips and ideas to make this website better
      and more informational. But for now, have fun and learn a lot about space!
      When you have learnt enough, you can test yourself on how good you are.
      And if you are one of those people who are bored and are browsing on the computer, looking for what to do, this
      will be the place for you. There will also be videos to show you how to do the subject you don't understand.
