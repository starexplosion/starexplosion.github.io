    <h2>Question</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left">How do levels of acidity affect a plants growth?</p>
    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left"> Plants grow normally when water is used on it. But weak acid, or a
        low
        amount of
        acid, can damage the plants by weakening the soil. This can lengthen the germination time of the plant, but
        might actually help the plant by the micronutrients it gives to the plants. That is why I think plants will
        grow best in weak acid, and worst in strong acid.</p>
    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left">My materials were:
        <ul>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Soil</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>Paper Cups</li>
            <li>Radish Seeds</li>
            <li>Centimeter Ruler</li>
            <li>Measuring Cups</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <img src="material1.png" title="These are the radish seeds.">
    <img src="material2.png" title="This is the soil.">
    <img src="material3.png" title="These are the lemons.">
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left">1- Take 6 cups and fill them with soil.<br>
        2-Place 4 seeds per pot, and then cover up the seeds again with a little more soil.<br>
        3-Split the cups into 3 groups, 2 cups per group. Label the groups as “Water”, “Weak Acid”, and “Strong
        Acid”.<br>
        4- Preparations- For the “Water” group, get tap water. For the “Weak Acid” group, get 50 mL water and 5 mL
        lemon juice and mix. For the “Strong Acid” group, use 10 mL water, and 30 mL lemon juice, and mix.<br>
        5- Everyday, pour 20 mL “Water” into each of the water cups. Pour 20 mL of the “Weak Acid” solution into
        each
        of the “Weak Acid” cups. Finally, pour 20 mL of the “Strong Acid” solution in each of the “Strong Acid”
        cups.<br>
        6-Record the average of the plants in each group daily, and put it in your science lab notebook.<br>
        7-Create a line graph based on the group, the days,and the average height of the plants.

    <h2>Data</h2>

    <img src="data.jpg" title="This is my graph">
    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left">Day 1- The plants didn’t start growing yet, and the soil looks
        normal.<br>
        Day 2- The plants started growing. In the “Water” group, 5 plants grew. In the “Weak Acid” group, 6 plants
        grew.
        Most of the “Water” group’s plants are taller than the “Weak Acid” group’s plants. In the strong Acid group,
        no
        plants grew, but the soil is a little white because of the acid (lemon juice).<br>
        Day 3- Each of the plants grew much taller, and some of the “Weak Acid”’s plants are starting to lean a
        little.<br>
        Day 4- Now there are 8 plants in the “Weak Acid” group (which is the maximum), but one of the new plants is
        drooping on the soil. One plant grew in the strong acid section, which is taller than the 2 new plants in
        the
        “Weak Acid” group.<br>
        Day 5- A lot of the plants in the “Water” group are the same height or taller than the plants in the “Weak
        Acid”
        group. The plant in the “Strong Acid” group has a thicker stem, compared to the other plants.<br>
        Day 6- One of the “Weak Acid” group’s plants got ripped of its stem, so I didn’t measure it. The “Water”
        group’s
        plants grew tall and healthy, and have a good color. There is still only one “Strong Acid” plant, and it is
        short.

    <h2 title="This is my conclusion.">Conclusion</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left">My hypothesis was wrong. In the end, water with plants grew the best
        plants
        because no liquid damaged it. The macronutrients in the water were more important in the growth of the
        plants
        than
        the micronutrients of the weak acid. For the “Weak Acid” group, the small amount of acid slightly damaged
        the
        soil,
        slowing and weakening the growth of the plants. The “Strong Acid” group’s soil got heavily damaged, so only
        one
        plant grew. What I would change next time when doing the experiment would to make more precise measurements
        of
        the
        plants, and I would test more strengths of acids on the plants.
